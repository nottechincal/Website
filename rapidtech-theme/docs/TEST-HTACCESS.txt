# .htaccess Verification Test

Copy your current /public_html/.htaccess content and paste it here to verify it's correct.

## What to Check:

1. **Search for:** new-themeWORKING6
   - Should find: **0 results** ✅
   - If you find ANY: ❌ .htaccess not updated

2. **Search for:** rapidtech-theme
   - Should find: **75 results** ✅
   - If less than 75: ❌ .htaccess not updated

3. **FAQ Rule Check:**
   - Find line starting with: RewriteRule ^faq
   - Should say: /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/faq.php
   - NOT: /wp-content/themes/new-themeWORKING6/faq.php

## Quick Command (if you have SSH access):

```bash
cd /public_html
grep -c "new-themeWORKING6" .htaccess
# Should return: 0

grep -c "rapidtech-theme" .htaccess
# Should return: 75
```

## If Incorrect:

Your .htaccess needs to be replaced with:
`rapidtech-theme/docs/DEPLOYMENT.htaccess`

Simply copy ALL content from DEPLOYMENT.htaccess and paste into /public_html/.htaccess

---

## Current Correct FAQ Rule:

```apache
# FAQ and Booking Pages
RewriteRule ^faq/?$ /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/faq.php [L]
RewriteRule ^book/?$ /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/book.php [L]
```

If your .htaccess has the OLD theme name, that's why FAQ returns 404!
