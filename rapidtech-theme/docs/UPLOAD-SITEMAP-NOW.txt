3. 6 service+location combo pages (virus-removal-dandenong, virus-removal-cranbourne, data-recovery-frankston, data-recovery-patterson-lakes, network-setup-berwick, emergency-computer-repair-melbourne)

========================================
STEP-BY-STEP FIX:
========================================

1. DELETE OLD SITEMAP ON SERVER
   - Go to your server file manager
   - Navigate to: /public_html/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/
   - Find: sitemap.xml
   - DELETE it (this is the old 57-URL version)

2. UPLOAD NEW SITEMAP
   - Download the file: SITEMAP-COMPLETE-74-URLS.xml (from this same folder)
   - Rename it to: sitemap.xml
   - Upload to: /public_html/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/sitemap.xml

3. VERIFY IT WORKED

========================================
QUICK CHECK:
========================================

Your OLD sitemap (57 URLs) ends with:
    <url>
        <loc>https://www.rapidtechsolutions.au/postcode-3201/</loc>
        ...
    </url>
</urlset>

Your NEW sitemap (74 URLs) has MORE entries after postcode-3201, including:
- FAQ page
- 10 new suburb pages
- 6 service+location pages

If you don't see these extra pages when you visit:
https://rapidtechsolutions.au/sitemap.xml

========================================
FILE LOCATION:

Download it, rename to sitemap.xml, and upload to your server.
