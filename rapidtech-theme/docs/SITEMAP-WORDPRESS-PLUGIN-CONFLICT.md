# SITEMAP BEING GENERATED BY WORDPRESS/PLUGIN - FIX GUIDE

## Problem Identified

You have the correct sitemap.xml file (74 URLs) on your server, but something else is generating and serving a different sitemap (57 URLs).

**Likely culprits:**
1. WordPress 5.5+ built-in sitemap (serves at /wp-sitemap.xml)
2. Yoast SEO plugin
3. Rank Math plugin
4. All in One SEO plugin
5. Google XML Sitemaps plugin

---

## Step 1: Find What's Generating the Sitemap

### Check WordPress Plugins

1. Log into WordPress admin: https://rapidtechsolutions.au/wp-admin
2. Go to **Plugins** → **Installed Plugins**
3. Look for any of these SEO plugins:
   - **Yoast SEO** (most common)
   - **Rank Math**
   - **All in One SEO**
   - **Google XML Sitemaps**
   - **Jetpack**

**Which one do you have installed?** This is generating the sitemap.

---

## Step 2: Disable Plugin Sitemap Generation

### If you have Yoast SEO:

1. Go to **SEO** → **General** (in WordPress admin)
2. Click **Features** tab
3. Find **XML sitemaps**
4. Toggle it **OFF** (disabled)
5. Click **Save Changes**

### If you have Rank Math:

1. Go to **Rank Math** → **Sitemap Settings**
2. Toggle **Sitemap** to **OFF**
3. Click **Save Changes**

### If you have All in One SEO:

1. Go to **All in One SEO** → **Sitemaps**
2. Toggle **Enable Sitemap** to **OFF**
3. Click **Save Changes**

### If you have Google XML Sitemaps plugin:

1. Go to **Plugins** → **Installed Plugins**
2. Find **Google XML Sitemaps**
3. Click **Deactivate**

## Step 3: Disable WordPress Built-in Sitemap

WordPress 5.5+ generates a sitemap automatically at `/wp-sitemap.xml`.

**Add this code to your theme's functions.php:**

Location: `/public_html/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/functions.php`

Add at the bottom (before the closing `?>` if it exists):

```php
// Disable WordPress default sitemap
add_filter( 'wp_sitemaps_enabled', '__return_false' );
```

**OR use a plugin:**
- Install **Disable XML-RPC Pingback** plugin
- OR install **Disable WP Sitemaps** plugin

---

## Step 4: Force Your Static Sitemap to Be Served

Add this to your `.htaccess` file (at the TOP, before WordPress rules):

```apache
# Force static sitemap.xml to be served
RewriteRule ^sitemap\.xml$ /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/sitemap.xml [L]
```

**Location:** `/public_html/.htaccess`

**Add it right after:** `RewriteEngine On`

---

## Step 5: Alternative - Put Sitemap in Root Directory

Instead of forcing the rewrite, you can copy your sitemap to the root:

1. **Copy** `/public_html/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/sitemap.xml`
2. **Paste** to `/public_html/sitemap.xml` (root)
3. This way it's served directly without any WordPress interference

---

## Step 6: Clear Cache & Test

1. **Clear all caches** (WordPress, Cloudflare, browser)
2. **Wait 5 minutes**
3. **Visit:** https://rapidtechsolutions.au/sitemap.xml
4. **Check:** Scroll to bottom, look for "virus-removal-dandenong" and "faq" entries
5. **If you see 74 URLs** → Success! ✅

## Quick Diagnosis

### Test which sitemap is being served:

Visit these URLs:

1. **https://rapidtechsolutions.au/sitemap.xml** (what you're seeing now - 57 URLs)
2. **https://rapidtechsolutions.au/wp-sitemap.xml** (WordPress built-in)
3. **https://rapidtechsolutions.au/sitemap_index.xml** (Yoast/Rank Math)
4. **https://rapidtechsolutions.au/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/sitemap.xml** (your static file - should be 74 URLs)

**If #4 shows 74 URLs** → Your file is correct, just not being served
**If #2 or #3 work** → WordPress/plugin is generating it

---

## Recommended Solution (Easiest)

**Option A: Use Plugin's Sitemap Generator**

If you have Yoast/Rank Math installed:
1. Keep the plugin's sitemap enabled
2. Make sure all your pages are set to be included
3. Let the plugin auto-generate the sitemap with all 74 pages

**The plugin might not be including your custom pages.** Check:
- WordPress admin → Pages → All Pages
- Make sure all 74 pages exist as WordPress pages
- If they're PHP files only (not WordPress pages), the plugin won't see them

**Option B: Force Your Static File**

If you want to use your static sitemap.xml:
1. Disable all plugin sitemaps (Step 2)
2. Disable WordPress sitemap (Step 3)
3. Copy sitemap to root directory (Step 5)
4. Clear cache

---

## Why This Happened

Your website has **74 custom PHP files** (not WordPress pages), so:
- WordPress doesn't know they exist
- SEO plugins can't auto-detect them
- They generate a sitemap based on WordPress database (only 57 "official" pages)

**Your custom sitemap.xml** lists all 74 pages manually, but it's not being served because WordPress/plugin is overriding it.

---

## What I Recommend

**Best solution:**

1. Copy your sitemap.xml to root: `/public_html/sitemap.xml`
2. Disable Yoast/plugin sitemap generation
3. Disable WordPress built-in sitemap (add code to functions.php)
4. Clear all caches
5. Submit the correct sitemap to Google Search Console

This way your static, hand-crafted sitemap (74 URLs) will be served instead of the auto-generated one (57 URLs).

## Files to Check

**Check if these exist on your server:**

1. `/public_html/sitemap.xml` (root) - What does this show?
2. `/public_html/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/sitemap.xml` (theme) - Should be 74 URLs
3. Check WordPress admin → Plugins → look for SEO plugins

**Then we'll know exactly what's generating it.**
