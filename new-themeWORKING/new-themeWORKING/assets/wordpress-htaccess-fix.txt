# =====================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# =====================================================

# 1. CHANGE "new-themeWORKING3" to your actual theme folder name!
#    Check what the folder is called on your server.

# 2. These rules must go BEFORE the WordPress block that looks like:
#    # BEGIN WordPress
#    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
#    RewriteEngine On
#    ...
#    # END WordPress

# 3. After adding, test a few URLs:
#    - https://rapidtechsolutions.au/blog-scam-protection/
#    - https://rapidtechsolutions.au/computer-repairs-cranbourne/
#    - https://rapidtechsolutions.au/service-areas/

# 4. If errors occur, check your server error logs

# =====================================================
# EXAMPLE OF COMPLETE ROOT .HTACCESS:
# =====================================================

# Your file should look something like this:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# [All the redirect rules from above go here]

# BEGIN WordPress
# The directives (lines) between "BEGIN WordPress" and "END WordPress" are
# dynamically generated, and should only be modified via WordPress filters.
# Any changes to the directives between these markers will be overwritten.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
