## HANDLING NEGATIVE FEEDBACK:

If customer expresses dissatisfaction:

1. **Don't ask for review** - Fix the problem first
2. **Apologise immediately** - "I'm sorry to hear that..."
3. **Offer solution** - "Let me make this right..."
4. **Follow up personally** - Call, don't email
5. **After resolution** - Then you can ask for review

- Review received (Y/N)
- Rating given
- Follow-up needed?

**Goal:** 1 review per week = 52 per year = Major SEO boost!

---

## LEGAL NOTES:

✅ **DO:**
- Ask satisfied customers for honest reviews
- Make it easy with direct links
- Thank customers for reviews
- Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Offer money or discounts FOR reviews (incentivize leaving review, not positive review)
- Fake reviews
- Ask only selected customers (selective solicitation)
- Pressure or harass customers
