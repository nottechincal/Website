# URGENT FAQ FIX - Copy This EXACTLY Into Your .htaccess

## The Problem
Your live server's .htaccess file is MISSING or has WRONG rewrite rules.

## The Solution - Copy These Lines

**Open your `/public_html/.htaccess` file in cPanel and add these lines AFTER the WordPress section:**

```apache
# FAQ and Booking Pages
RewriteRule ^faq/?$ /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/faq.php [L]
RewriteRule ^book/?$ /wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/book.php [L]
```

**OR replace the ENTIRE .htaccess file with the complete one from:**
`rapidtech-theme/docs/DEPLOYMENT.htaccess`

---

## Quick Test After Adding

Visit: https://rapidtechsolutions.au/faq/

**Should work immediately!** (No cache clear needed for .htaccess)

If it STILL doesn't work, your WordPress installation might be in a different location. Check:
- Is WordPress in `/public_html/` or `/public_html/wordpress/`?
- Is the theme folder EXACTLY: `/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/`?

---

## Alternative: Direct Test

Try visiting the file directly:
https://rapidtechsolutions.au/wp-content/themes/rapidtech-theme/faq.php

**If that works** = theme is correct, .htaccess is wrong
**If that 404s** = theme not uploaded correctly
